\section{Introduction}
%What is the problem?
Better instruments, faster and bigger supercomputers and easier collaboration and sharing of data in the sciences have introduced the need
to manage increasingly large data sets. Data-intensive systems and architectures have been developed with the goal of storing and providing
fast access to such data sets. Examples include the GrayWulf and DataScope clusters \cite{Szalay, TODO} at JHU, which have capacity of 1.1PB and xPB
respectively. These systems differ from the traditional HPC systems in that they aim to achieve high aggregate throughput by balancing computation
capabilities with I/O and network bandwidth. Subsequently, applications developed on top of these platforms have to make efficient use of all that they
have to offer. The tasks performed in a typical workflow are often data-intensive, but in a lot of case they can also be computationally intensive. 
This calls for the development of new methods for the efficient evaluation of the queries submitted to the system.

Finding the locations or regions of highest vorticity or those with the largest norms of the velocity or other fields of interest is
functionality that enables new insights in the study of fluid dynamics. Furthermore, threshold, top-k queries and similarity search in general
are important in many different disciplines \cite{TODO}. In this paper we introduce an efficient evaluation strategy for threshold
queries over time series datasets stored in a cluster of relational databases. 

%Why is it hard? (E.g., why do naive approaches fail?)
The evaluation of threshold queries requires a kernel computation accessing several data points to be evaluated at each point on the grid.
This means that in order to evaluate such a query for a given time step all of the data for that time step must be read and each data point 
will appear in $N$ kernels of computation, where $N$ is the size of the kernel. The evaluation is thus both data and computation intensive.

%Why is it interesting and important?
Thresholding allows scientists to obtain and examine the most intense regions and features in the dataset in the case of turbulence. 
These are often the locations that have the largest vorticity norms and have intense vortices or reconnection events. 
It is important that threshold queries are evaluated in an efficient manner, because often further subsequent examination
and analysis is required to understand the physics behind these intense events. 

%Why hasn't it been solved before? (Or, what's wrong with previous proposed solutions? How does mine differ?)
Data-intensive architectures, clusters, etc. have only recently emerged and the systems that run on them often don't support
all of the functionality that scientists are interested in. In this paper we present a method for the efficient evaluation of 
threshold queries over numerical simulation data stored in a cluster of relational databases. We exploit the parallelism 
available in the cluster by means of data parallel execution of the computations and moreover introduce an application-aware
cache to store the query results. 

%What are the key components of my approach and results? Also include any specific limitations.
- 3d and 4d clusters of highest vorticity locations. 

- Lays the ground work for the creation of a landmark database, which could store the location of the highest vorticity regions in the dataset.

- The introduction of an application-aware cache improves the running time of queries substantially if there is a cache hit and there is 
little downside to storing query results in the cache.

- The evaluation scales with the amount of parallelism available in the cluster. 

-The evaluation is computationally limited and embarrassingly parallel, which makes it a good candidate for a GPU implementation.

\section{Scientific Use Cases}
Max vorticity clustering.

\section{JHTDB}
The JHTDB store the entire space-time history of high-resolution fluid dynamics numerical simulations in
a cluster of relational databases.
Access to the data is provided by means of Web-services and a variety of analysis functions have been
implemented and can be executed through Web-service calls.
At present there are three datasets available publicly and one more available internally and to collaborators. 
The data are the output of numerical simulations of forced isotropic turbulence, magnetohydrodynamics, channel 
flow turbulence and homogenous buoyancy driven turbulence.
The total amount of space occupied by the datasets is over 150 TB. 

The database nodes are part of the GrayWulf \cite{Szalay} and DataScope \cite{TODO} clusters. Each node
is running Windows Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008 R2. The data are partitioned spatially across 4 to 8
database nodes, and each database node hosts one or more databases. We use the Morton z-order space-filling
curve to distribute the data across nodes and databases as well as to spatially subdivide each time step
into database atoms, which are of size $8^3$. Each such atom is indexed by the time step, which it belongs to and
by the Morton code of it's lower left corner. This combination of index and data forms a record in the database.
Queries to the data and derived fields, such as derivatives and filtered quantities are evaluated through
stored procedures or user-defined functions implemented in the Common Language Runtime (CLR) framework.

The Web-services are hosted on a front-end Web-server, which handles user requests and hosts the main Webpage portal.
The Web-server acts as a mediator sending the users' requests to the database nodes and initiating their distributed evaluation. 
It assembles the results and sends them back to the client

\section{Threshold Query Evaluation}
Application-aware cache that effectively caches not only data, but also computational effort. 
In the case of thresholding what is cached are the results of the computation. 
This means that the computation does not have to be repeated and the amount of data cached is several orders of magnitude smaller than the raw data.

First, check the cache. If data are available in the cache return them from there.
Make sure that the threshold stored in the cache is lower than the one specified.
If the threshold stored in the cache is higher or the data are not available perform the computation. 
After the results are sent back store the data in the cache.
If the cache does not have enough space to store the new data, delete the least recently used
cached entries to free up space.
This is all done within a transaction.

\section{Experimental Results}
-- measure the overhead of querying the cache first

-- measure time taken to perform the thresholding computation for an entire time step on a cold cache

-- measure time taken to evaluate the query after warming up the cache and polluting it afterward

-- compare with local evaluation

-- provide scaling measurements

\section{Related Work}
Asfalg et al. introduce the concept of threshold queries in time series databases \cite{Asfalg}. Their definition of threshold queries differs from the threshold
queries described in this paper. They are concerned with determining the time series, which exceed a user-defined threshold at time frames similar to
the time series specified in the query. Thus, their definition of threshold queries is concerned with the temporal relationship between the time series
stored in the database (usually one dimensional sequence of measurements) and the time series given in the query. In contrast, our approach focuses on
reporting all of the spatial locations of a multidimensional field where the norm or absolute value of the field exceeds a user prescribed threshold.

In a system called the tree cache Lopez et al. \cite{Lopez} make use of a small application-aware cache to reduce access time to large datasets stored on
disk. The tree cache stores individual octants of octree datasets and exploits application-specific information to determine which octants to cache and to 
perform query reordering. This work has inspired the use of an application-aware cache for the evaluation of threshold queries. In contrast to the tree cache
we do not cache raw data objects, but rather query results. This substantially reduces the size of the cache and improves query performance.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

%% \section{The {\secit Body} of The Paper}
%% Typically, the body of a paper is organized
%% into a hierarchical structure, with numbered or unnumbered
%% headings for sections, subsections, sub-subsections, and even
%% smaller sections.  The command \texttt{{\char'134}section} that
%% precedes this paragraph is part of such a
%% hierarchy.\footnote{This is the second footnote.  It
%% starts a series of three footnotes that add nothing
%% informational, but just give an idea of how footnotes work
%% and look. It is a wordy one, just so you see
%% how a longish one plays out.} \LaTeX\ handles the numbering
%% and placement of these headings for you, when you use
%% the appropriate heading commands around the titles
%% of the headings.  If you want a sub-subsection or
%% smaller part to be unnumbered in your output, simply append an
%% asterisk to the command name.  Examples of both
%% numbered and unnumbered headings will appear throughout the
%% balance of this sample document.

%% Because the entire article is contained in
%% the \textbf{document} environment, you can indicate the
%% start of a new paragraph with a blank line in your
%% input file; that is why this sentence forms a separate paragraph.

%% \subsection{Type Changes and {\subsecit Special} Characters}
%% We have already seen several typeface changes in this sample.  You
%% can indicate italicized words or phrases in your text with
%% the command \texttt{{\char'134}textit}; emboldening with the
%% command \texttt{{\char'134}textbf}
%% and typewriter-style (for instance, for computer code) with
%% \texttt{{\char'134}texttt}.  But remember, you do not
%% have to indicate typestyle changes when such changes are
%% part of the \textit{structural} elements of your
%% article; for instance, the heading of this subsection will
%% be in a sans serif\footnote{A third footnote, here.
%% Let's make this a rather short one to
%% see how it looks.} typeface, but that is handled by the
%% document class file. Take care with the use
%% of\footnote{A fourth, and last, footnote.}
%% the curly braces in typeface changes; they mark
%% the beginning and end of
%% the text that is to be in the different typeface.

%% You can use whatever symbols, accented characters, or
%% non-English characters you need anywhere in your document;
%% you can find a complete list of what is
%% available in the \textit{\LaTeX\
%% User's Guide}\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

%% \subsection{Math Equations}
%% You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
%% inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of
%% the three are discussed in the next sections.

%% \subsubsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
%% A formula that appears in the running text is called an
%% inline or in-text formula.  It is produced by the
%% \textbf{math} environment, which can be
%% invoked with the usual \texttt{{\char'134}begin. . .{\char'134}end}
%% construction or with the short form \texttt{\$. . .\$}. You
%% can use any of the symbols and structures,
%% from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
%% \LaTeX\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a
%% few examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how
%% this equation: \begin{math}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{math},
%% set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
%% set in display style.  (See next section).

%% \subsubsection{Display Equations}
%% A numbered display equation -- one set off by vertical space
%% from the text and centered horizontally -- is produced
%% by the \textbf{equation} environment. An unnumbered display
%% equation is produced by the \textbf{displaymath} environment.

%% Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols
%% and structures available in \LaTeX; this section will just
%% give a couple of examples of display equations in context.
%% First, consider the equation, shown as an inline equation above:
%% \begin{equation}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{equation}
%% Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
%% the \textbf{displaymath}
%% environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
%% \begin{displaymath}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1\end{displaymath}
%% and follow it with another numbered equation:
%% \begin{equation}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f\end{equation}
%% just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

%% \subsection{Citations}
%% Citations to articles \cite{bowman:reasoning, clark:pct, braams:babel, herlihy:methodology},
%% conference
%% proceedings \cite{clark:pct} or books \cite{salas:calculus, Lamport:LaTeX} listed
%% in the Bibliography section of your
%% article will occur throughout the text of your article.
%% You should use BibTeX to automatically produce this bibliography;
%% you simply need to insert one of several citation commands with
%% a key of the item cited in the proper location in
%% the \texttt{.tex} file \cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.
%% The key is a short reference you invent to uniquely
%% identify each work; in this sample document, the key is
%% the first author's surname and a
%% word from the title.  This identifying key is included
%% with each item in the \texttt{.bib} file for your article.

%% The details of the construction of the \texttt{.bib} file
%% are beyond the scope of this sample document, but more
%% information can be found in the \textit{Author's Guide},
%% and exhaustive details in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's
%% Guide}\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

%% This article shows only the plainest form
%% of the citation command, using \texttt{{\char'134}cite}.
%% This is what is stipulated in the SIGS style specifications.
%% No other citation format is endorsed.

%% \subsection{Tables}
%% Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best
%% placement for them is typically the top of the page
%% nearest their initial cite.  To
%% ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
%% environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and
%% the table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go
%% in the \textbf{tabular} environment, to
%% be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired
%% horizontal and vertical rules.  Again, detailed instructions
%% on \textbf{tabular} material
%% is found in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

%% Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
%% Table 1 is included in the input file; compare the
%% placement of the table here with the table in the printed
%% dvi output of this document.

%% \begin{table}
%% \centering
%% \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
%% \begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
%% Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\ \hline
%% \O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\ \hline
%% $\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\ \hline
%% \$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\ \hline
%% $\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
%% \hline\end{tabular}
%% \end{table}

%% To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of
%% the page's live area, use the environment
%% \textbf{table*} to enclose the table's contents and
%% the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this wide
%% table will ``float" to a location deemed more desirable.
%% Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
%% Table 2 is included in the input file; again, it is
%% instructive to compare the placement of the
%% table here with the table in the printed dvi
%% output of this document.

%% \begin{table*}
%% \centering
%% \caption{Some Typical Commands}
%% \begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
%% Command&A Number&Comments\\ \hline
%% \texttt{{\char'134}alignauthor} & 100& Author alignment\\ \hline
%% \texttt{{\char'134}numberofauthors}& 200& Author enumeration\\ \hline
%% \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\ \hline
%% \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\ \hline\end{tabular}
%% \end{table*}
%% % end the environment with {table*}, NOTE not {table}!

%% \subsection{Figures}
%% Like tables, figures cannot be split across pages; the
%% best placement for them
%% is typically the top or the bottom of the page nearest
%% their initial cite.  To ensure this proper ``floating'' placement
%% of figures, use the environment
%% \textbf{figure} to enclose the figure and its caption.

%% This sample document contains examples of \textbf{.eps}
%% and \textbf{.ps} files to be displayable with \LaTeX.  More
%% details on each of these is found in the \textit{Author's Guide}.

%% \begin{figure}
%% \centering
%% \epsfig{file=fly.eps}
%% \caption{A sample black and white graphic (.eps format).}
%% \end{figure}

%% \begin{figure}
%% \centering
%% \epsfig{file=fly.eps, height=1in, width=1in}
%% \caption{A sample black and white graphic (.eps format)
%% that has been resized with the \texttt{epsfig} command.}
%% \end{figure}

%% As was the case with tables, you may want a figure
%% that spans two columns.  To do this, and still to
%% ensure proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the environment
%% \textbf{figure*} to enclose the figure and its caption.

%% Note that either {\textbf{.ps}} or {\textbf{.eps}} formats are
%% used; use
%% the \texttt{{\char'134}epsfig} or \texttt{{\char'134}psfig}
%% commands as appropriate for the different file types.

%% \subsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
%% Other common constructs that may occur in your article are
%% the forms for logical constructs like theorems, axioms,
%% corollaries and proofs.  There are
%% two forms, one produced by the
%% command \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} and the
%% other by the command \texttt{{\char'134}newdef}; perhaps
%% the clearest and easiest way to distinguish them is
%% to compare the two in the output of this sample document:

%% This uses the \textbf{theorem} environment, created by
%% the\linebreak\texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} command:
%% \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
%% \begin{theorem}
%% Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$.  If $G$ is
%% an antiderivative for $f$ on $[a,b]$, then
%% \begin{displaymath}\int^b_af(t)dt = G(b) - G(a).\end{displaymath}
%% \end{theorem}

%% The other uses the \textbf{definition} environment, created
%% by the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command:
%% \newdef{definition}{Definition}

%% Two lists of constructs that use one of these
%% forms is given in the
%% \textit{Author's  Guidelines}.

%% \begin{figure*}
%% \centering
%% \epsfig{file=flies.eps}
%% \caption{A sample black and white graphic (.eps format)
%% that needs to span two columns of text.}
%% \end{figure*}
%% and don't forget to end the environment with
%% {figure*}, not {figure}!
 
%% There is one other similar construct environment, which is
%% already set up
%% for you; i.e. you must \textit{not} use
%% a \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to
%% create it: the \textbf{proof} environment.  Here
%% is a example of its use:
%% \begin{proof}
%% Suppose on the contrary there exists a real number $L$ such that
%% \begin{displaymath}
%% \lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L.
%% \end{displaymath}
%% Then
%% \begin{displaymath}
%% l=\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x)
%% = \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
%% \left[ g{x} \cdot \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right ]
%% = \lim_{x\rightarrow c} g(x) \cdot \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
%% \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0\cdot L = 0,
%% \end{displaymath}
%% which contradicts our assumption that $l\neq 0$.
%% \end{proof}

%% Complete rules about using these environments and using the
%% two different creation commands are in the
%% \textit{Author's Guide}; please consult it for more
%% detailed instructions.  If you need to use another construct,
%% not listed therein, which you want to have the same
%% formatting as the Theorem
%% or the Definition\cite{salas:calculus} shown above,
%% use the \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} or the
%% \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command,
%% respectively, to create it.

%% \subsection*{A {\secit Caveat} for the \TeX\ Expert}
%% Because you have just been given permission to
%% use the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to create a
%% new form, you might think you can
%% use \TeX's \texttt{{\char'134}def} to create a
%% new command: \textit{Please refrain from doing this!}
%% Remember that your \LaTeX\ source code is primarily intended
%% to create camera-ready copy, but may be converted
%% to other forms -- e.g. HTML. If you inadvertently omit
%% some or all of the \texttt{{\char'134}def}s recompilation will
%% be, to say the least, problematic.

%% \section{Conclusions}
%% This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.
%% Remember that you might still have Acknowledgments or
%% Appendices; brief samples of these
%% follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and
%% we will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception
%% of the reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in
%% this paper are to articles which have nothing to
%% do with the present subject and are used as
%% examples only.

\section{Acknowledgment}

%% %ACKNOWLEDGMENTS are optional
%% \section{Acknowledgments}
%% This section is optional; it is a location for you
%% to acknowledge grants, funding, editing assistance and
%% what have you.  In the present case, for example, the
%% authors would like to thank Gerald Murray of ACM for
%% his help in codifying this \textit{Author's Guide}
%% and the \textbf{.cls} and \textbf{.tex} files that it describes.

%
% The following two commands are all you need in the
% initial runs of your .tex file to
% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
\bibliography{paper}  % sigproc.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case
% You must have a proper ".bib" file
%  and remember to run:
% latex bibtex latex latex
% to resolve all references
%
% ACM needs 'a single self-contained file'!
%
%APPENDICES are optional

%% %Appendix A
%% \section{Headings in Appendices}
%% The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for
%% the body of the article are different in the appendices.
%% In the \textbf{appendix} environment, the command
%% \textbf{section} is used to
%% indicate the start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order
%% designation (i.e. the first is A, the second B, etc.) and
%% a title (if you include one).  So, if you need
%% hierarchical structure
%% \textit{within} an Appendix, start with \textbf{subsection} as the
%% highest level. Here is an outline of the body of this
%% document in Appendix-appropriate form:
%% \subsection{Introduction}
%% \subsection{The Body of the Paper}
%% \subsubsection{Type Changes and  Special Characters}
%% \subsubsection{Math Equations}
%% \paragraph{Inline (In-text) Equations}
%% \paragraph{Display Equations}
%% \subsubsection{Citations}
%% \subsubsection{Tables}
%% \subsubsection{Figures}
%% \subsubsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
%% \subsubsection*{A Caveat for the \TeX\ Expert}
%% \subsection{Conclusions}
%% \subsection{Acknowledgments}
%% \subsection{Additional Authors}
%% This section is inserted by \LaTeX; you do not insert it.
%% You just add the names and information in the
%% \texttt{{\char'134}additionalauthors} command at the start
%% of the document.
%% \subsection{References}
%% Generated by bibtex from your ~.bib file.  Run latex,
%% then bibtex, then latex twice (to resolve references)
%% to create the ~.bbl file.  Insert that ~.bbl file into
%% the .tex source file and comment out
%% the command \texttt{{\char'134}thebibliography}.
%% % This next section command marks the start of
%% % Appendix B, and does not continue the present hierarchy
%% \section{More Help for the Hardy}
%% The acm\_proc\_article-sp document class file itself is chock-full of succinct
%% and helpful comments.  If you consider yourself a moderately
%% experienced to expert user of \LaTeX, you may find reading
%% it useful but please remember not to change it.
%% \balancecolumns
%% % That's all folks!
